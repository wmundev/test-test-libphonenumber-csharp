Known Issues
------------

- Phone numbers metadata is read from XML files and not protocol
  buffers one. I could not make it work using protobuf-csharp
  library. On the other hand, it makes one less dependency.


Todo
----

- Restore the Java logging calls?
- Find a suitable replace for Java CharSequence in phone numbers parsing API.
- Migrate geocoder and related files
